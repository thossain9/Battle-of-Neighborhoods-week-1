    "We like to start a restaurant business either in a borough of the City of Toronto or of New York. Lets select Scarborough in Toronto and Manhattan in New York. Now, we are to select the best option between these two. \n",
    "\n",
    "Better decision depend on many factors; main factors are:\n",
    "a. Population in each borough.\n",
    "b. Numbers of restaurant in each borough.\n",
    "c. Types of restaurant in each borough\n",
    "d. Population size in each borough.\n",
    "e. Income level of people in each borough.\n",
    "f. Purchasing power of people in each borough.\n",
    "g. Social Environment of each borough.\n",
    "h. Location Map of restaurant in each borough; for these we need to take assistance from Foursquare App.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we are considering all these factors ?\n",
    "a. If population size is comparatively higher then more people will go for eating in the restaurant.\n",
    "b. If number of restaurant is comparatively lower, the proportion of the customer will be more.\n",
    "c. If average income is more, purchasing power will be more resulting more customer tends to go to restaurant.\n",
    "d. In the better social environment people can comfortably enjoy passing times, going to restaurnt.\n",

    "### How these data will solve the problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "a. By analyzing these data we will find roation number of restaurant to the population of each borough. Assuming other\n",
    "   factors like- purchasing power, social environment and the others remain same, we can reach to conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now we need to search for relevant data.\n",

    "A. For relevant data of Manhattan, we use the following link\n",

    "\n",
    "which gives us 'Borough', 'Neighborhood', 'Latitude', 'Longitude'\n",
    "B. For population data we use kaggle's borough-wise population in new york. \n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/new-york-city-population\n",
    "\n",
    "C. For data of Toronto we use the following link.\n",

    "D. For all the geographical coordinates of the neighborhoodswe used “https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data” csv file \n",
